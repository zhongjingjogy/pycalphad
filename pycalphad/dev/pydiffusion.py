TODO:
Here comes the todo list for developing dictra-like module to deal with
substitutional phase (only one valid sublattice).
1. implement the module to calculate interdiffusivities from the atomic mobility.
2. a simulation module to simulate the diffusion couple with the thermodynamic
database and kinetic database.
3. new module for optimizing the interaction parameter in atomic mobility 
according to the interdiffusivities obtained  from others.
